		<h1>SDEV 1022: HTML/CSS Basics</h1>
		<p>In this course I went through a very broad overview of developing web pages with HTML and then using CSS to style the pages. I learned the common tags and layout for an HTML page. For CSS I learned everything from using a linear gradient for coloring a background to using the CSS to control the image that you place on the HTML page. With going through this course I also was able to build a couple of websites that held multiple pages as well as get a brief introduction to JavaScript. I feel like learning these tools are good things for any beginning programmer to know.</p>
		<p>While I worked through this course I felt like it was a great starting point in this program. When I took CS 1300 at Weber State, I got a broad overview of some of the tools that I used in this course, but this course has given me a much more in depth view on how to work with these tools. I built a website with multiple pages and learned how to link them all together. Even though I didn't get a lot of experience with JavaScript, having the fundamentals of HTML and CSS has been a huge help with my future learning on my own.</p>
