		<h1>CS 1030: Intro to Computer Science</h1>
		<p>When I realized that my current path of study that was leaning towards the medical field wasn't for me, I spent some time trying to figure out what I wanted to do with school and as a career. I had always been interested in what makes computers work, but didn't have any real knowledge of what it would be like. So, after talking to an advisor from the Computer Science Department at Weber State, I took this class and in the same semester signed up for CS 1400, which you can see more about under that course's page.</p>
		<p>This course gave a very good but very shallow look into a few key things in computer science. It was mainly dipping your feet into a few different topics so that you can see a few of the many paths available to you in programming, split into three parts. It began with HTML and CSS, and gave some very broad overview of the sort of things needed to build a basic web page such as HTML format, putting in tables, h1 - h6 tags, and paragraph, bold, and italics tags.</p>
		<p>After finishing the first third of the course, it moved into the basics of SQL. I ended up doing basic SQL queries and learning a little bit about how databases worked. It only went over the very basics of querying though, and didn't even go in so far as joinging tables.</p>
		<p>The final section of the course was an introduction to programming. It used Java because the next course that people take in their steps through the Computer Science program is normally CS 1400, if they don't take them together. It went over things such as looping, booleans, integers, random numbers, and a little bit into arrays. The final project I did was a simple program that I called a simple version of the game "craps" where if you roll a certain number you win, and if you don't roll one of those specific numbers, you lose.</p>
		<p>As I said at the start of talking about this course, it gave a very shallow overview of a few of the big topics that people learn about in Computer Science. But it was also a very important class for me. I was interested in Computer Science before I began this course but didn't know what to expect from it. This course cemented it into a desire and passion to learn more. I remember my first basic web page, and how excited I was by building it. I even took a screenshot and sent it in my family's group text, although my brothers weren't all that impressed. But the pride in knowing that I made that web page, even as simple as it was, was a huge awakening to me and made me hungry to learn so much more.</p>
