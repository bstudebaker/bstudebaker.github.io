		<h1>Work History</h1>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>I've worked a lot of jobs in my life. Growing up I was raised to believe that if you wanted something then you had to work for it. I started working when I was 10 years old and started doing a paper route, and when I was 16 I got my first hourly job. I haven't had a great track record of staying in a job for extremely long periods of time, that is something that has changed in the last few years. And that is something that I am not looking for with a new job. I want to find employment where I am mentally engaged enough to be self fulfilled and grow further. So I know that while my work history may not give the most confidence, I can guarantee that it is not an indication of my work ethic or dedication to what I have planned for my career.</p>
		<p>The best thing about my work history, in my opinion, is that I've had a very broad range of experiences from many different jobs. It has made it so that I've worked with many different types of people as coworkers and have interacted with many different types of customers. All of my experiences have made me grow to find the career that I want and become the person that I have grown to be.</p><br>
