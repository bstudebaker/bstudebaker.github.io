		<h1>SDEV 2041: C# Programming 1</h1>
		<p>This course went over the first part of learning the C# language. It began with learning the syntax of printing statements and performing calculations. After getting through the language basics it moved on to looping and exception handling, followed by teaching object oriented programming using classes, structs, and enumerations. The final parts of the course went through arrays, array lists, inheritance, and abstract classes. In general the programs were build as console projects but there were some that were built as GUI projects.</p>
		<p>This has probably been my favorite language to learn so far. The flow of it just feels more natural to me. I found myself struggling a little towards the end with interfaces and abstract classes, but I got through and feel like Iâ€™ve learned a lot. I also feel like this gave me a much deeper understanding about some things I struggled with in Java such as arrays and array lists.</p>
