		<h1>Education</h1>
		<p>Here you can see a list of my classes that I have taken between Weber State University and the Davis Technical College, as well as a more in depth explanation of the different languages that I have learned on my own. Feel free to look through them to get an idea of the experience I have developed through my learning.</p>
		<h3>Weber State University</h3>
		<p>I did two semesters at Weber State, during which I really struggled to understand that concepts being taught while continuing with my studies outside of the Computer Science Department. I only ended up taking a couple of courses before realizing that I needed a more focused learning system to get learn coding before returning to Weber State to finish my Bachelor's Degree. Below are listed the two courses that I took.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href = "CS1030.html">
					CS 1030: Intro to Computer Science
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "CS1400.html">
					CS 1400: Intro to Programming
				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Davis Technical College</h3>
		<p>After realizing that I needed a more focused approach of just learning programming fundamentals, I started the Software Development program at the Davis Technical College. Through it, and the courses I have listed below, I have grown and learned a lot. Below are the courses that I have taken.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV1022.html">
					SDEV 1022: HTML/CSS Basics
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV1032.html">
					SDEV 1032: Programming Basics
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV1041.html">
					SDEV 1041: SQL Programming Fundamentals
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "ITEC1018.html">
					ITEC 1018: Linux Essentials
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV1090.html">
					SDEV 1090: Version Control
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV1060.html">
					SDEV 1060: Unit Testing
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV2410.html">
					SDEV 2410: C# Programming 1
				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href = "SDEV2420.html">
					SDEV 2420: C# Programming 2
				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Personal Study</h3>
		<p>I think the most that I've learned has come from studying things on my own. Things that I've learned in classes have definitely made it so that I understand the basics, but I feel like I've learned a lot more in depth with a lot of topics than I did in classes. Here are topics that I have gone over on my own. Feel free to look through my self-study topics and see projects that I have built from my self-study.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Git and Github</li>
			<li>Web Development</li>
			<li>Javascript, Node.js</li>
		</ul>
