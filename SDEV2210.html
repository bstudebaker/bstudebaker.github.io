		<h1>SDEV 2210 Java Programming 1</h1>
		<p>This course went over the first half of the Java training available at the college. It began with the basics, with things such as loops, booleans, sums, and getting user input. From there it moved into different things such as object oriented programming, Arrays, and ArrayLists. This is the same language that I used in CS 1400 at Weber State and really helped fill in the gaps for things that I wasn’t understanding when I took that class.</p>
		<p>My biggest struggle with this course ended up being combining Arrays and object oriented programming. I managed to move through the course fairly quickly until I hit that point. After a lot of practice, I managed to get through and make good headway to understanding what I was missing. I definitely think that this is my favorite class up to this point because of the challenge. It confirmed my feelings about programming, I haven’t found anything as satisfying as this before.</p>
		<p>This course also fits the requirements for Weber State University's CS 1400. When I return there after finishing this program, I will get transfer credits.</p>
